Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm LawMixer, a 19-year-old software engineer doing full-time back-end development & cybersecurity.  

Most people know me (as contributor, or staff) from:
[Orosius Laboratories](https://usrc.orosiuslabs.com/), the group behind Project: Ethos, the game to craft an immersive 2000's themed research facility that transports you to a world of scientific exploration.
[interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py), basically, my contributions to the Python discord bot library. 
[Roblox Compiler Collection](https://github.com/roblox-compilers), is a collection of compilers to compile a language to Roblox Lua(u), the RCC group makes all of these compilers.
[Parcel Roblox](https://parcelroblox.com/), is a service to developers and group owners to sell virtual assets easily. A lot of value is put into providing a stable service with barely any outages or interruptions.


If you need to contact me, I'd prefer Discord (@lawmixer) since I'm very active on there, enjoy!
